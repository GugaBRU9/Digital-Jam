Project Overview
This project is a store management simulation designed to run in a computer terminal. It allows users to register
 products or services offered by the store, as well as manage customer records.

A key feature of this system is its customer loyalty program, which automatically applies discounts to frequent customers
based on a predefined number of purchases and total amount spent.

Additionally, the software includes a data analysis module that processes sales data in real-time, providing insights
through graphical visualizations of past and current transactions. Users can filter sales by specific time periods,
enhancing the decision-making process.

Technologies Used
-> Python – Core programming language
-> Control Structures – Basic functions, conditionals, and loops
-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Use of classes to organize the system
-> Pandas – File manipulation and data processing
-> Seaborn – Data visualization and graphical representation of sales
-> Datetime – Handling and filtering sales data based on specific time periods

This project aims to enhance store efficiency, optimize customer engagement, and provide valuable business insights
through a streamlined and user-friendly interface.
